# üîß Work in progress
# HoGiahLang: The Accounting App

This is a minimal accounting desktop application built with [Wails](https://wails.io/).
The application allows users to save and have an overview of their asset distributions.

Aim to provide a simple accounting application that can be used to track assets and liabilities. Ultimately, help everyone to become **h√≥-giaÃçh-l√¢ng**, Taiwanese for rich people üí∞.

## Features

- Input and save total assets.
- Persist data using SQLite.
- Cross-platform desktop application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.19+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14+)
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleAccountingApp.git
   cd SimpleAccountingApp
   ```

2. **Install Go dependencies:**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Run the application in development mode:**

   ```bash
   wails dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and the application will open in a window.

### Building the Application

To build the application for your operating system:

```bash
wails build
```
This command will generate the executable in the `build/bin` directory.

### Testing the Application

To run the tests:

```bash
go test ./<package name in backend>
```

## Release of the software

The release of the software is automated using the GitHub Actions. The release is triggered when a new tag is pushed to the repository. The release will create a new release with the binaries for MacOS universal architechture.

### Versioning

**Semantic versioning** is used for versioning the software. The [action pipeline](.github/workflows/semantic_versioning.yml) will create a new release by incrementing the version number based on the commit messages and tag the repo with calculated version.
